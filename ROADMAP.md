# Roadmap
## Planned
- Add option to toggle logging
- Add option to turn on/off backups of instance and saves folders
- Make a general-purpose archiver with the same idea
## Complete
- Remove temporary files even after failure (e.g. in a 'finally' block)
- Remove temporary files all at once, not in between backups
- Add a multithreading option with `robocopy`'s `/mt` parameter
